# 🚀 Solana Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my Solana development learning repository! This showcases my progress through the **Ackee School of Solana Season 7** curriculum and demonstrates my growing expertise in building real-world Solana programs.

## 📚 Learning Progress

### 🎓 Current Course: Ackee School of Solana Season 7
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Focus**: Building production-ready Solana programs
- **Methodology**: Hands-on project-based learning

## 🏗️ Project Showcase

### Lesson 4: Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) & Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)

**🎯 What This Demonstrates:**
This project showcases advanced Solana development concepts including Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) and Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) - fundamental building blocks for DeFi protocols and complex blockchain applications.

**🔧 Key Features:**
- **Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)**: Program A calls System Program to transfer SOL
- **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**: Deterministic account generation using seeds
- **PDA as Signer**: Using `invoke_signed()` for secure cross-program calls
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with local validator integration
- **Production-Ready Code**: Proper error handling and security patterns

**🏗️ Real-World Applications:**
- DeFi lending protocols
- NFT marketplaces
- DAO governance systems
- Cross-program token transfers
- Secure multi-signature operations
