# Lesson 6: Frontend for Solana Apps Learning Summary & Personal Insights

## What I Learned
- Full-stack dApp: Ticket registry with Anchor backend.
- Tools: create-solana-dapp for init, Codama for client gen, deployment to Devnet with airdrop.
- Integration: Wallet signing, instruction building, on-chain validation.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
- Seeds for automatic validation (e.g., unique events per organizer/name).
- Manual checks needed beyond init_space (e.g., string lengths).
- Frontend-backend sync: Fetch/decode accounts, handle timestamps.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Skills Developed
- Building Anchor programs with CPIs (transfers).
- Generating/fixing Codama clients.
- Next.js components for dApp UI (forms, lists, buttons).
- Transaction processing (blockhash, signing).

## ðŸš€ How This Helps My Development
- Enables complete dApps from program to UI.
- Prepares for real-world deployment/testing.
