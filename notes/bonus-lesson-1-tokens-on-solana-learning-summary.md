# Bonus Lesson 1: Tokens on Solana Learning Summary & Personal Insights

## What I Learned
- Token types, Token 2022 extensions.
- Core concepts: Token programs (SPL/Token 2022), mint accounts (authority/supply/decimals), token accounts (balance/delegate/state), associated accounts (deterministic).
- Token 2022: Extensions (e.g., transfer fees) for advanced features.
- Example program: Anchor-based mint with fees, instructions for init/mint/transfer/withdraw.

##  Key Insights
- Tokens extend SOL via programs; 2022 adds modularity for custom behaviors.
- Associated accounts simplify transfers without knowing recipient details.
- Mint/token separation enables flexible management (e.g., authorities, freezing).
- Extensions can be incompatible; choose based on needs.

##  Technical Skills Developed
- Creating mints with Token 2022 extensions in Anchor.
- Implementing instructions (init, mint, transfer, withdraw) with CPIs.
- Using constraints for account creation/validation.
- Testing token flows (balances, fees).

##  How This Helps My Development
- Enables building token-based dApps (e.g., with fees).
- Improves integration of SPL tokens in projects.
- Prepares for advanced standards like 2022.

##  Resources to Remember
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/school-of-solana/blob/master/Bonus-Tokens (code, examples)
- Token 2022 Docs: [Solana Docs Link]

##  Next Steps
### **Immediate**
- Experiment with other extensions (e.g., non-transferable).
- Build token airdrop script.

### **Future**
- Integrate into full dApps (e.g., governance tokens).

## üèÜ Confidence Level
**Before**: Basic token awareness.  
**After**: Proficient in Token 2022.

**Confidence**: High - Ready for token projects.

## üí≠ Personal Reflection
Tokens' modularity in 2022 opens creative possibilities; hands-on clarified relationships‚Äîexcited for custom assets.

##  Key Takeaways
1. SPL vs. 2022: Basic vs. extensible.
2. Accounts: Mint defines, token holds.
3. Associated: Deterministic for ease.
4. Extensions: Modular for features like fees.
5. Anchor: Simplifies token CPIs.

##  Application to My Projects
### **Current Projects**
- Add token minting with fees.
- Use associated accounts for transfers.

### **Future Projects**
- Create utility/governance tokens.
- Explore NFT extensions.
