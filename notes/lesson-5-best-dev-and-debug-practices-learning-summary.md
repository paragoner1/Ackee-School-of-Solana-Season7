# Lesson 5: Best Dev & Debug Practices Learning Summary & Personal Insights

## What I Learned
- Best practices: Modular code, visualize flows.
- Debugging: Handle signatures, simulations, custom errors; use logs, skip preflight, check allocations/PDAs.
- Testing: Unit tests in Rust, integration with Anchor, fuzzing with Trident; test unhappy paths.

## Key Insights
- Modularization prevents spaghetti code; visualization aids security/testing.
- Never trust back-end; validate everything on-chain.
- High test coverage (including errors) prevents exploits.
- Debugging often involves logs and Solana source code.

## Technical Skills Developed
- Structuring Anchor projects (modules, instructions/state).
- Writing Rust unit tests and TypeScript integration tests.
- Error handling (require macros, custom errors).
- Using tools like Trident for fuzzing.

## How This Helps My Development
- Improves code maintainability and bug resolution speed.
- Prepares for secure, testable Solana programs.
- Enhances workflow with automation and visualization.

## Resources to Remember
- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/school-of-solana/tree/master/5.lesson (examples, workflows)
- Solana Docs: Program errors/instructions
- Trident: Fuzz testing for Anchor

## Next Steps
### **Immediate**
- Modularize existing projects; add workflows.
- Practice debugging with sample bugs.

### **Future**
- Integrate fuzzing into final project.

## Confidence Level
**Before**: Basic debugging.  
**After**: Skilled in practices/testing.

**Confidence**: High - Ready for complex programs.

## Personal Reflection
These practices make development efficient; hands-on clarified common pitfallsâ€”valuable for real-world Solana work.

## Key Takeaways
1. Modularize for maintainability.
2. Visualize to catch logic flaws.
3. Test everything, especially errors.
4. Debug with logs and tricks.
5. Validate on-chain always.

## Application to My Projects
### **Current Projects**
- Add modular structure and tests.
- Implement workflows for PRs.

### **Future Projects**
- Use visualization for program design.
- Incorporate fuzzing for security.
